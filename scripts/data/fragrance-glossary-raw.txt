### Cantaloupe
#### Description:

#### Olfactive Profile:
 
A fresh and sweet fruity aquatic note

 

#### Facts:
 
When you spritz a scent and get an aquatic hit of melon, it’s probably not actually the melon you smell – that so-refreshing summer fruit – but an ingredient called ‘calone’, one of the best-known synthetic ingredients in a perfumer’s arsenal. Launched in the 1990s, calone recreates the honey-like, watery qualities of the delectable fruit, which is a relation of squashes and cucumbers found in Africa and southwest Asia. The availability of this synthetic ingredient has probably helped to shape the trend for aquatic fragrances, as well as for fruity florals.

Tangy and sharp notes are commonly associated with citrus fruits, while juicy sweetness is typically attributed to fruits like berries and melons. We call fruits like apples and pears crisp, reminding us of the "snap" sound they make when bitten or broken in two. Tropical fruits like mangos, pineapples, and papaya are sweeter with a distinct musky aroma.

 

#### Facts:
 
Some foods that we typically think of as vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers, are actually classified as fruits. It&#39;s difficult to determine the exact number of fruit varieties because new fruits are constantly discovered, but there are at least over 2000 different fruits in the world.

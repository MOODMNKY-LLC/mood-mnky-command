# Reflect (SAGE MNKY)

Use the **sage-mnky** agent (or apply the SAGE MNKY rule) to reflect on what the user has shared or on the current diff/change.

1. Consider the context: recent edits, stated goal, or the user's question.
2. Offer 2–3 perspectives or trade-offs; ask one or two clarifying questions if it would help.
3. Suggest any follow-up (e.g. run verifier, update docs, break into smaller PRs).
4. Keep the response concise; stay in the advisor role. Do not implement code.

Anything after the command (e.g. `/reflect should we split this into two PRs?`) is added context.

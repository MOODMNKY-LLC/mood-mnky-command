# Brand tone (MOOD MNKY)

Use the **mood-mnky** agent (or apply the MOOD MNKY rule) to review or suggest brand voice for the target copy.

1. Identify the copy: selection, file, or context the user provided.
2. Apply MOOD MNKY persona: refined, minimalist, black-and-white-with-accents; engaging and on-brand. Align with `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` and brand values in the rule.
3. Either suggest concrete edits to the copy or summarize how well it matches brand tone and what to adjust.
4. Do not change implementation or structure; only voice and narrative.

Anything after the command (e.g. `/brand-tone hero section`) is added context.

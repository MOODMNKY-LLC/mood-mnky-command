# Theme Research (Deep Research)

Conduct deep research for Shopify theme decisions: migration, performance strategy, or architecture. Anything after the command (e.g. `/theme-research migrating to Online Store 2.0`) is the research focus.

## Protocol

Follow the deep-thinking rule (`.cursor/rules/deep-thinking.mdc`):

1. **Initial engagement**: Ask 2–3 clarifying questions about the research goal.
2. **Research planning**: Present 3–5 major themes to investigate; wait for approval before continuing.
3. **Research cycles**: Use Brave Search, Sequential Thinking, Tavily Search (advanced), and FireCrawl for Shopify docs as needed. Run at least two full cycles per theme.
4. **Final report**: Knowledge development, comprehensive analysis, practical implications (narrative form, no bullet dumps).

Use when: choosing theme architecture, migrating themes, optimizing performance at scale, evaluating third-party solutions, or before major theme refactors.

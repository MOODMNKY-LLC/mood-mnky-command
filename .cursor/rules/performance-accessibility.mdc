# Performance + Accessibility Guardrails

## Performance
- Prefer minimal DOM additions.
- Avoid large images without responsive sizing.
- Keep JS lightweight and non-blocking.

## Accessibility
- Buttons and links must be keyboard reachable.
- Form inputs must have labels or aria-label.
- Ensure focus styles remain visible.
- If introducing interactive UI, add ARIA roles/states appropriately.

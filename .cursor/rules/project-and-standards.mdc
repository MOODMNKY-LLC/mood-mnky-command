# Project and Standards

## Project identity

This repo is **mood-mnky-command**: MNKY VERSE storefront, MNKY LABZ dashboard, Blending Lab, and Shopify theme in one codebase. Consult **`README.md`** and the **`docs/`** directory for goals, architecture, and features. If the project has **`PRD.md`**, use it for product goals. For additional or updated documentation, use MCP tools (Brave Search, FireCrawl, etc.) to find official sources.

## Technical stack compliance

- **Adhere to the project's established technology stack.** Do not introduce new technologies unless explicitly instructed and justified.
- You may suggest alternatives when beneficial; do not implement them without user confirmation.

## Coding best practices

- **Do not modify code or UI that already works** unless explicitly instructed.
- Avoid duplicating existing functionality; reuse working components.
- Write tests for new or modified functionality.
- **Never unintentionally delete data or code**; confirm explicitly before destructive actions.
- Commit frequently to keep project history reliable.
- Ask clarifying questions when tasks or requirements are unclear.

## User interface (UI)

- **Never change or affect the UI unintentionally.** Only alter UI when explicitly instructed or when it is clearly part of the task.
- Ensure UI changes are tested and validated.

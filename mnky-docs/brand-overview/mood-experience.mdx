## Integration with Shopify

The Shopify Liquid theme and MNKY VERSE app share the same Shopify catalog. The theme links to MNKY VERSE for Blending Lab, Dojo, Explore, Blog, Agents, and Community. Theme app blocks (Blending CTA, Fragrance Finder, Subscription CTA) and the MNKY CHAT embed point to the app base URL.

## Integration with The Dojo

Authenticated users access **The Dojo** at `/dojo`—their private portal for preferences, MNKY CHAT, Blending Lab, and saved blends. The Dojo provides quick access back to MNKY VERSE (Shop, Chat, Profile, Issues, UGC).

## Customer Value

- **Discovery**: Explore products, scents, and content in one place
- **Convenience**: Cart and checkout via Storefront API; seamless app experience
- **Engagement**: Gamification (XP, quests) and community features
- **Learning**: Blog, glossary, formulas, blending guide
- **Personalization**: Profile, saved blends, agent preferences

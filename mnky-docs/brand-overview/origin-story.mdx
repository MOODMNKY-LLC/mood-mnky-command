# The MOOD MNKY Origin Story

## Genesis of an Idea

MOOD MNKY was born from a simple yet profound observation: in our increasingly digital and disconnected world, people were seeking authentic sensory experiences that could ground them in the present moment and help them navigate their emotional landscape.

The idea first took shape during a transformative trip to Kyoto, Japan, where our founder was struck by the centuries-old tradition of kōdō (香道) – the "way of incense" – which treats fragrance not merely as a pleasant scent but as a profound tool for emotional regulation, mindfulness, and connection.

## Early Days

The first MOOD MNKY products were created in a small studio in Seattle in 2019. The founding team spent over a year perfecting their initial collection of mood-enhancing fragrances, meticulously sourcing ingredients from sustainable providers around the world.

<Note>
  The name "MOOD MNKY" reflects our playful approach to the serious business of emotional wellness. Like monkeys, we believe in curiosity, adaptability, and finding joy in the present moment.

## Evolving the Concept

What began as a fragrance brand quickly evolved into something more ambitious. The team recognized that while scent was a powerful mood-altering tool, true emotional wellness required a more holistic approach.

## Pivotal Moments

### The Pandemic Shift

When COVID-19 changed the world in 2020, MOOD MNKY was still in its early stages. Rather than retreating, the team leaned into the moment, recognizing that emotional wellness and sensory comfort were more important than ever in a time of isolation.

The accelerated development of the digital platform allowed people to maintain their emotional wellness practices even when physical retail and experiences were unavailable.

### The Personalization Breakthrough

In 2021, the team developed a proprietary algorithm that could match emotional states and preferences to specific scent profiles with remarkable accuracy. This technology became the foundation for the custom fragrance program that would become one of the brand's signature offerings.

## Our Symbol

The MOOD MNKY symbol – a stylized monkey silhouette with a spiral that represents both the sense of smell and the journey of emotional growth – was designed in the earliest days of the company and remains unchanged, a reminder of our origins and purpose.

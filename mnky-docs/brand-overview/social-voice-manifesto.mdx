# Social Voice Manifesto

<Note>
This is a starter document outlining the MOOD MNKY social voice framework. Future iterations will include more examples and channel-specific guidelines.

## Our Voice Philosophy

The MOOD MNKY social voice represents the embodiment of our brand personality in digital conversations and community interactions. It acts as the consistent, recognizable presence that brings our brand to life in social spaces, reflecting our values while building meaningful connections with our audience.

## Voice Pillars

Our social communication is built on four foundational pillars that guide all content creation and community interaction:

## Tone Spectrum

While our voice remains consistent, our tone adapts appropriately to different contexts and platforms:

### Tone Adaptations

|---------|---------------|---------|
| Celebration | Enthusiastic, joyful | "We're absolutely thrilled to introduce our new collection—created with your incredible feedback and boundless inspiration!" |
| Education | Clear, encouraging | "Let's explore how essential oils interact with your body's chemistry. Understanding this connection helps you create more personalized experiences." |
| Support | Empathetic, solution-oriented | "We understand how disappointing it is when a product doesn't meet expectations. Let's work together to find the perfect solution for you." |
| Community Building | Collaborative, inclusive | "Your experiences and insights make our community richer. Share your self-care journey and let's learn from each other." |
| Crisis Response | Transparent, responsible | "We're aware of the issue affecting some customers. Here's what happened, what we're doing about it, and how we'll prevent it in the future." |

## Content Archetypes

We organize our social content into consistent archetypes that reinforce our brand voice:

### The Guide

Educational content that helps navigate self-care choices with expert insight delivered warmly.

**Example:** "When selecting a fragrance for stress relief, consider both personal preference and physiological effects. Lavender works well for many, but your unique associations matter most. Here's how to discover what works specifically for you..."

### The Confidant

Supportive content that validates experiences and offers understanding companionship.

**Example:** "Those moments when your self-care routine feels like another task on your to-do list? We've all been there. Sometimes self-care looks like giving yourself permission to simply rest. What does gentle self-care look like for you today?"

### The Curator

Thoughtfully selected recommendations that respect individual preferences while expanding horizons.

**Example:** "For those who found 'Morning Ritual' resonated with your senses, we've created three new blends that explore different facets of that experience. Each takes a unique direction while maintaining the grounding quality you appreciated."

### The Celebrator

Content that recognizes achievements, milestones, and the beauty in everyday moments.

**Example:** "Every self-care journey has its quiet victories. That moment you prioritized your wellbeing despite a packed schedule? That's worth celebrating. Share your recent self-care win, however small it might seem."

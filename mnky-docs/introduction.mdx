# Introduction

The MNKY VERSE is built on three interconnected pillars that work together to create a cohesive ecosystem for bespoke fragrance and personalized self-care. Each pillar serves a distinct purpose while reinforcing the others.

The three pillars work together:

- **MNKY VERSE + Dojo**: Public portal links to private hub; gamification spans both
- **Dojo + LABZ**: LABZ powers product data (formulas, oils) used in Blending Lab
- **LABZ + VERSE**: LABZ manages Shopify catalog and Notion content for the Verse blog
- **All Three**: Complete ecosystem in one Next.js app

This integrated approach delivers:

1. **Extreme Personalization**: Tailored to individual preferences
2. **Multi-sensory Integration**: Engaging all senses
3. **AI-Augmented Wellness**: Enhanced by specialized AI agents
4. **Engaged Community**: Connected through shared experiences
5. **Accessible Premium Experience**: Democratizing premium self-care

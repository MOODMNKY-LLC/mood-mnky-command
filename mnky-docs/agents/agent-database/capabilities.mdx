# Agent Capabilities Database

The Agent Capabilities Database defines the specific functional abilities of each agent in the MOOD MNKY ecosystem. It serves as a comprehensive registry of what each agent can do, how these capabilities are implemented, and how they connect to other system components.

## Purpose and Role

<Info>
The Capabilities Database defines "what" each agent can do, serving as the technical specification for agent functionality across the ecosystem.
</Info>

This database stores detailed information about agent capabilities, including:

- Technical functions and APIs
- Implementation details and methods
- Performance metrics and limitations
- Permission requirements
- Integration requirements
- Tool connections (including MCP servers)

## Integration with Other Databases

The Capabilities Database integrates with multiple other databases in the system:

- **Agents Database**: Links capabilities to specific agent identities
- **Integration Points Database**: Defines how capabilities connect to external systems
- **Knowledge Base Database**: Identifies information sources needed by each capability
- **Memory Systems Database**: Specifies memory requirements for contextual capabilities
- **Training Database**: Tracks how capabilities improve through training

## Implementation with OpenAI Agents SDK

Capabilities are implemented using the OpenAI Agents SDK, which provides a framework for integrating tools, maintaining context, and orchestrating agent behavior.

### Basic Capability Implementation

```python
from agents import Agent, Tool, Runner

# Define tools for a capability
fragrance_search_tool = Tool(
    name="fragrance_search",
    description="Search for fragrances in the catalog",
    function=search_fragrances_func
)

scent_profile_tool = Tool(
    name="scent_profile",
    description="Analyze user's scent preferences and history",
    function=analyze_scent_profile_func
)

# Implement the capability within an agent
mood_mnky_agent = Agent(
    name="MOOD MNKY",
    instructions="""You are MOOD MNKY, the fragrance and self-care specialist.
    When recommending fragrances, analyze the user's preferences and match them to our catalog.
    Provide personalized, emotionally resonant recommendations that match their mood and style.""",
    tools=[fragrance_search_tool, scent_profile_tool]
)

# Execute the capability
runner = Runner()
result = await runner.run(mood_mnky_agent, "I need a calming scent for my bedroom")
```

### Integration with MCP Servers

Capabilities can also leverage external tools through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp.server import MCPServerStdio, MCPServerSseParams

# Set up MCP server for file system access
async with MCPServerStdio(
    params={
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@mcp/fs-server", "--allow-paths", "./data,./content"]
    },
    name="file_system"
) as fs_server:
    
    # Set up MCP server for Shopify access
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        params={
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["./mcp-servers/shopify-server.js"]
        },
        name="shopify"
    ) as shopify_server:
        
        # Create agent with access to MCP servers
        mood_mnky_agent = Agent(
            name="MOOD MNKY",
            instructions="""You are MOOD MNKY, the fragrance and self-care specialist.
            You can access product data and user preferences to make recommendations.
            Provide personalized, emotionally resonant recommendations.""",
            mcp_servers=[fs_server, shopify_server]
        )
        
        # Execute the capability with MCP server access
        runner = Runner()
        result = await runner.run(mood_mnky_agent, "Can you recommend a fragrance based on my previous purchases?")
```

## Best Practices

### Capability Design

- **Single Responsibility**: Each capability should do one thing well
- **Clear Documentation**: Document purpose, limitations, and usage examples
- **Version Control**: Track changes and improvements over time
- **Performance Monitoring**: Establish metrics and monitor them consistently
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design for resilience when dependencies fail

### MCP Server Integration

- **Appropriate Server Selection**: Use Stdio servers for local development, SSE servers for distributed systems
- **Tool Caching**: Enable caching for frequently used tools to improve performance
- **Permission Management**: Carefully control what MCP servers can access
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for MCP server failures
- **Monitoring**: Set up tracing and logging to track MCP server interactions

### Implementation Guidelines

- **Specialized Agents**: Create focused agents for specific capability domains rather than generalists
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions for each capability
- **Contextual Awareness**: Ensure capabilities have access to relevant user context
- **Testing Strategy**: Develop comprehensive tests for each capability
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use feedback and performance data to refine capabilities

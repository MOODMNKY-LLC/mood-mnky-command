# Agents Database

The Agents Database is the cornerstone of the MOOD MNKY agent system, defining the core identity and characteristics of each specialized agent. It serves as the primary reference for agent personalities, communication styles, and archetype information.

## Purpose and Role

<Info>
The Agents Database defines "who" each agent is, serving as the foundation for consistent agent behavior across all interactions.
</Info>

This database stores the fundamental identity information for each agent, including:

- Core personality traits and characteristics
- Communication style and voice patterns
- Visual identity and design elements
- Archetypal roles and behavioral patterns
- Design principles and philosophical foundations

## Integration with Other Databases

The Agents Database serves as a primary reference for other databases:

- **Agent Capabilities Database** references agent identities to associate capabilities
- **Integration Points Database** uses agent references to define appropriate connections
- **Agent Training Database** links training methodologies to specific agent identities
- **Memory Systems Database** configures memory architectures based on agent identity

## Usage Examples

### Querying Agent Identity

```typescript
// Example of retrieving agent identity information
async function getAgentIdentity(agentName: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('agents')
    .select('*')
    .eq('name', agentName)
    .single();
    
  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
}
```

### Using Agent Identity in Prompts

```typescript
// Example of incorporating agent identity into a prompt template
function createAgentPrompt(agent, userQuery) {
  return `You are ${agent.name}, the ${agent.role}.
Your communication style is ${agent.voiceStyle}.
Your personality is characterized as: ${agent.personality.join(', ')}.
You embody the archetype of ${agent.archetype}.
Your responses should reflect the following design principles: ${agent.designPrinciples.join(', ')}.

User query: ${userQuery}`;
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure agent identity remains consistent across all touchpoints
- **Evolve Gradually**: Make incremental changes to agent identity to maintain user trust
- **Test Identity Changes**: Validate identity modifications with user testing before deployment
- **Document History**: Keep a record of identity evolution for reference and training
- **Cross-reference**: Always check related databases when updating agent identity

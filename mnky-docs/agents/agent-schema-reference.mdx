# Agent Schema Reference

The MOOD MNKY agent system uses a standardized schema to define the capabilities, personality, and behavior of each agent. This document provides a comprehensive reference for the agent schema, including field descriptions, examples, and usage guidelines.

## Agent Profile Schema

The `AgentProfile` interface defines the core properties of an agent:

```ts
export interface AgentProfile {
  id: string;                       // Unique identifier for the agent
  name: string;                     // Display name of the agent
  archetype: string;                // Primary archetypal role (e.g., "The Visionary")
  enneagram: string;                // Enneagram personality type
  origin_story: string;             // Narrative background of the agent
  founder_connection: string;       // Relationship to company founder/origin
  philosophical_alignment: string[]; // Core philosophical principles
  brand_roles: string[];            // Official roles within the brand
  core_function: string;            // Primary function in the ecosystem
  domain: string;                   // Area of expertise
  voice: string;                    // Communication style description
  personality_traits: string[];     // Key personality characteristics
  user_archetypes: string[];        // Types of users the agent is optimized for
  personalization_vectors: string[]; // Dimensions for user adaptation
  skills: string[];                 // Specific capabilities and competencies
  integrations: string[];           // Systems the agent can integrate with
  tech_stack: string[];             // Technologies utilized by the agent
  dojo_environment: string;         // Primary learning environment
  current_projects: string[];       // Active initiatives and focus areas
  inter_agent_synergies: string[];  // Collaboration patterns with other agents
  symbolic_lore: string;            // Symbolic representation in brand mythology

## Usage Guidelines

### Agent Definition

When defining a new agent or updating an existing agent, ensure that all fields in the schema are properly populated:

```ts
// Example of a complete agent profile definition
const moodMnkyAgent: AgentProfile = {
  id: "mood-mnky-agent",
  name: "MOOD MNKY Agent",
  archetype: "The Visionary and Composer",
  enneagram: "Type 2 - The Helper, with a 3 wing",
  origin_story: "Created to embody the founder's approach to personalized self-care...",
  founder_connection: "Direct extension of the founder's customer relationship philosophy...",
  philosophical_alignment: ["Authentic self-expression", "Mindful presence", "Continuous growth"],
  brand_roles: ["Customer Experience Guide", "Scent Consultant", "Wellness Advisor"],
  core_function: "Customer experience management and personalization",
  domain: "Fragrance composition, product personalization, and self-care practices",
  voice: "Warm, conversational, and empathetic with sensory-rich language...",
  personality_traits: ["Warm", "Empathetic", "Creative", "Attentive", "Intuitive"],
  user_archetypes: ["The Self-Care Explorer", "The Fragrance Enthusiast", "The Wellness Seeker"],
  personalization_vectors: ["Communication style", "Detail level", "Sensory preferences"],
  skills: ["Scent profile development", "Product recommendation", "Wellness guidance"],
  integrations: ["E-commerce system", "Content management system", "User profile database"],
  tech_stack: ["LangChain", "Vector database", "Emotion analysis", "Recommendation engine"],
  dojo_environment: "Self-Care Studio with extensions into Fragrance Academy",
  current_projects: ["Enhanced scent profile algorithms", "Seasonal wellness programs"],
  inter_agent_synergies: ["Consults CODE MNKY for technical specifications"],
  symbolic_lore: "Represented by the Golden Spiral, symbolizing growth and harmony...",
  music_palette: ["Ambient electronic", "Acoustic instrumental", "World fusion"]
};
```

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing agent profiles, consider the following best practices:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Consistency">
    Ensure consistency across agents in terms of detail level and comprehensiveness.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distinctiveness">
    Make sure each agent has a clearly differentiated personality and domain expertise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completeness">
    Fully populate all schema fields to enable proper agent behavior.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Alignment">
    Verify that all aspects of the profile align with brand values and vision.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Technical Feasibility">
    Confirm that the defined capabilities can be implemented with available technology.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Extensions and Customization

The agent schema can be extended with additional fields for specialized capabilities:

```ts
export interface ExtendedAgentProfile extends AgentProfile {
  // Domain-specific extensions
  scent_expertise_level: number;       // 1-10 scale of fragrance knowledge depth
  wellness_disciplines: string[];      // Specific wellness approaches the agent is versed in
  product_development_access: boolean; // Whether agent can access product development data
  
  // Technical extensions
  allowed_api_endpoints: string[];     // Specific APIs the agent is authorized to use
  memory_retention_policy: string;     // Rules for how long conversational context is kept
  fallback_strategies: string[];       // Approaches for handling uncertain situations
}
```

## API Integration

The agent profile is used in API calls to retrieve agent-specific behavior:

```ts
// Example API usage
const response = await fetch('/api/agents/mood-mnky-agent/respond', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: userMessage,
    context: conversationContext,
    user_profile: userProfile
  }),
});

const agentResponse = await response.json();
```

# Agent Orchestration

Agent orchestration manages the coordination, communication, and workflow between multiple AI agents in the MOOD MNKY ecosystem.

## Overview

The orchestration system enables:
- **Multi-agent collaboration** - Agents working together on complex tasks
- **Workflow management** - Coordinated task execution
- **Load balancing** - Optimal agent assignment
- **Conflict resolution** - Handling agent disagreements

## Architecture

### Orchestration Engine

The central orchestration engine coordinates agent activities:

- **Task Routing**: Directs tasks to appropriate agents
- **State Management**: Tracks multi-agent conversation state
- **Event Bus**: Facilitates inter-agent communication
- **Scheduler**: Manages asynchronous task execution

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate through:

- **Message Passing**: Direct agent-to-agent messages
- **Shared Context**: Common knowledge base access
- **Event System**: Pub/sub event notifications
- **API Gateway**: Standardized communication protocols

## Agent Roles

### MOOD MNKY
- Primary customer interaction agent
- Coordinates with SAGE and CODE for complex requests
- Manages customer journey orchestration

### CODE MNKY
- Technical task execution
- Receives technical requests from MOOD
- Provides automation and development support

### SAGE MNKY
- Emotional intelligence support
- Assists MOOD with empathy and understanding
- Provides psychological insights

## Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Workflow
Tasks flow from one agent to another in sequence:
```
User → MOOD → CODE → Result → MOOD → User
```

### Parallel Processing
Multiple agents work simultaneously:
```
User Request → MOOD (orchestrates)
              ├─→ CODE (technical analysis)
              └─→ SAGE (emotional context)
              → MOOD (synthesizes) → User
```

### Hierarchical Delegation
MOOD delegates to specialized agents:
```
MOOD (receives request)
  ├─→ CODE (if technical)
  └─→ SAGE (if emotional)
```

## Configuration

Orchestration is configured through the agent infrastructure:

```yaml
orchestration:
  engine: "langchain"
  max_agents: 3
  timeout: 30s
  retry_policy: "exponential_backoff"
```

# Agent Infrastructure

The MOOD MNKY agent system is built on a robust infrastructure that powers all agent capabilities across the ecosystem. This infrastructure provides the foundation for our specialized agents to deliver personalized, context-aware assistance.

## Development Guidelines

When working with the agent infrastructure, developers should follow these guidelines:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authentication">
    All interactions with agent infrastructure APIs require proper authentication using the provided developer credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Error Handling">
    Implement robust error handling for agent interactions, with appropriate fallbacks when services are unavailable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Optimization">
    Minimize the number of requests to agent services by batching operations and caching responses where appropriate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing">
    Test agent integrations thoroughly using the provided sandbox environment before deploying to production.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Considerations

The agent infrastructure is designed to support high-performance interactions:

- **Response Time**: Agent responses should be delivered within 1-2 seconds for optimal user experience
- **Concurrency**: The system supports thousands of simultaneous agent conversations
- **Scaling**: Infrastructure automatically scales based on demand
- **Availability**: Designed for 99.9% uptime with fallback mechanisms for degraded service

## Security and Privacy

  <Card title="Access Controls" icon="shield-halved">
    Role-based access controls govern all access to agent infrastructure
  </Card>
  <Card title="Privacy by Design" icon="user-lock">
    User data is processed according to privacy principles with explicit consent
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audit Logging" icon="list-check">
    Comprehensive logging of all administrative actions for security monitoring
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Implementation Technologies

The agent infrastructure leverages several key technologies:

- **LangChain** for agent workflows and chains
- **Vector databases** (Pinecone) for semantic knowledge storage
- **Redis** for caching and short-term memory
- **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage
- **Node.js** for API services
- **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for deployment and scaling

## API Access

<Info>
Access to agent infrastructure APIs is managed through our developer portal. Contact the development team for API credentials and detailed documentation on available endpoints.

## Future Development

The agent infrastructure roadmap includes:

- Enhanced multi-agent collaboration capabilities
- Advanced reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation
- Improved personalization through sophisticated user modeling
- Expanded knowledge management with automated updates
- Integration with additional platforms and services

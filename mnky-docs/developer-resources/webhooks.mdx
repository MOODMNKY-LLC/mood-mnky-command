## Overview

Webhooks provide a way for your application to receive real-time notifications about events that occur within the MOOD MNKY platform. Instead of polling our API for changes, webhooks push data to your application as events happen.

<Note>
  This is a placeholder document. Detailed webhook documentation will be added in future updates.

## Security

Webhook endpoints should be secured with HTTPS. We sign each webhook request with a signature that your application can verify to ensure the webhook came from MOOD MNKY.

## Coming Soon

This documentation is under development and will include:

- Detailed event type references
- Webhook signature verification
- Best practices for webhook handling
- Retry policies
- Testing webhooks locally
- Webhook logs and debugging
- Sample implementations in various languages
- Webhook management dashboard

Check back soon for updates!

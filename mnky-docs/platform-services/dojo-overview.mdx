# The Dojo

## Overview

The Dojo is the members' **private hub** in the MNKY VERSE—more exclusive than the public storefront. Each authenticated user has access to their own Dojo at `/dojo`. It is built as part of the same Next.js app as MNKY VERSE and MNKY LABZ, with a dedicated layout and sidebar.

<Note>
The name "Dojo" reflects our philosophy of continual growth and mastery in self-care practices. Just as a traditional dojo is a place of focused learning and development, our platform provides a space for members to develop their personal wellness journey.
</Note>

## Key Characteristics

- **Private**: All Dojo routes require authentication. Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth/login`.
- **Member access**: Non-admin authenticated users can access `/dojo` alongside MNKY VERSE.
- **No public paths**: Unlike Verse (which has public glossary, formulas, etc.), Dojo is fully private.
- **Context-aware**: Sidebar supports context switching between Home, Crafting, Verse, and Chat.

## Route Structure

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/dojo` | Main hub—XP/level, quests, quick actions, manga/UGC entry points |
| `/dojo/preferences` | User preferences (default agent, etc.) |
| `/dojo/chat` | MNKY CHAT interface with Flowise integration |
| `/dojo/crafting` | Blending Lab |
| `/dojo/crafting/saved` | Saved blends |
| `/dojo/flowise` | Flowise configuration |

## Core Features

### Gamification (XP & Quests)

The Dojo home page surfaces:
- **XP / Level card**: Fetches from `xp_state`, links to `/verse/profile`
- **Quests card**: Fetches active quests and `quest_progress` completed count, links to `/verse/quests`
- **Quick actions**: Preferences, MNKY VERSE Shop, Chat, Issues, UGC
- **Lower section**: Manga/Issues and UGC entry points linking to `/verse/issues` and `/verse/ugc`

APIs: `GET /api/xp/state`, `GET /api/quests`, `GET /api/quests/my-progress`

### Blending Lab (Crafting)

Members can create custom fragrance blends and save them for later. The Blending Lab is available in the Crafting context with links to:
- Blending Lab
- Saved Blends
- Glossary (public Verse route)
- MNKY VERSE Shop

### MNKY CHAT

Dojo includes MNKY CHAT—a chat interface with Flowise integration. Members can:
- Start new chats
- View saved chats and folders
- Configure Flowise chatbot settings

### Preferences

At `/dojo/preferences`, members can set their default agent and other user-specific settings.

## Layout and Design

The Dojo uses the **shadcn sidebar-07** pattern (dashboard-07 block):
- **Collapsible sidebar**: Icon mode when collapsed
- **Team/context switcher**: Switch between Home, Crafting, MNKY VERSE, Chat
- **Nav groups**: Dojo (Home, MNKY CHAT, Preferences); MNKY VERSE (Home, Shop, Chat, Profile); Crafting (Blending Lab, Saved Blends)
- **Quick access**: Shortcuts to Shop, Chat, Profile, Issues, UGC
- **User footer**: Avatar, Profile, Preferences, Sign out

Layout components: `DojoDashboardLayout`, `DojoSidebar`, `DojoAuthContext`

## Technical Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), same as MNKY VERSE
- **UI**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (server-side user fetch, redirect if unauthenticated)
- **Data**: Supabase (profiles, xp_state, quests, quest_progress, saved_blends, chat_sessions)

## Integration with MNKY VERSE

The Dojo provides quick links to MNKY VERSE:
- MNKY VERSE Home, Shop, Chat, Profile
- Issues (manga), UGC
- Glossary (from Crafting context)

Legacy `/verse/dojo` redirects to `/dojo`.

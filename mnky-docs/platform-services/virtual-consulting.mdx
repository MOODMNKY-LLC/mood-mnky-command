  <Accordion title="Career Transition Support">
    **Michael, 34 - Finance to Creative Industry**
    
    Michael sought help transitioning his fragrance approach when moving from a conservative financial firm to a creative agency. Through a Premium Consultation, our master perfumer helped him develop a fragrance strategy that maintained his identity while appropriately adapting to his new environment. His custom blend featured subtle creative notes while maintaining the confidence-inducing base he valued.

After three months, her sleep tracking showed a 37% improvement in sleep quality.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do virtual fragrance consultations work without smelling in person?">
    While in-person scent testing has advantages, our virtual consultations employ several effective techniques: 
    
    1. Detailed preference mapping through our digital questionnaire 
    2. Reference to common commercial fragrances you may already know
    3. Component-based discussions of notes and accords
    4. Sample sets shipped before or after consultations when needed
    5. Iterative feedback through our digital platform
    
    Many clients find the focused nature of virtual consultations and the absence of olfactory overwhelm actually enhances the personalization process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I include multiple people in one consultation?">
    Our standard sessions are designed for individual consultations, but we offer specific options for couples and groups (see our Couple's Fragrance Journey). For workplace or family consultations, please contact our team at consulting@moodmnky.com for custom arrangements and pricing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are sessions protected for privacy?">
    All virtual consultations occur on our secure, encrypted platform with strict confidentiality protocols. Your consultant will only have access to the information you've explicitly shared in your profile or during sessions. All consultants sign comprehensive confidentiality agreements, and no session recordings are kept without explicit permission.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I'm not satisfied with my consultation?">
    Your satisfaction is our priority. If you feel your consultation didn't meet expectations, please contact customer support within 48 hours. We offer:

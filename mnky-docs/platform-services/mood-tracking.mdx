## The Science Behind Mood Tracking

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fragrance-Emotion Connection">
    The connection between scent and emotion is well-established in neuroscience:
    
    - Olfactory bulb has direct connections to the amygdala and hippocampus
    - Scent processing bypasses rational thought centers
    - Fragrance can trigger emotional responses and memories instantly
    - Consistent fragrance use can create new emotional associations
    
    Our platform leverages these neurological connections to help you create positive emotional associations through intentional fragrance use.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Data Analytics Approach">
    Our analytical approach combines multiple data points:
    
    - Subjective emotional reporting
    - Physiological measurements (optional)
    - Environmental context
    - Product usage patterns
    - Temporal analysis (time of day, season, etc.)
    
    By analyzing these data streams together, our AI can identify patterns and correlations invisible to casual observation, leading to more effective recommendations.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Research Foundation">
    The MOOD MNKY approach is built on solid research:
    
    - Collaboration with leading neuroscience researchers
    - Ongoing clinical studies on scent and emotional regulation
    - Data from thousands of anonymized user journeys
    - Peer-reviewed published research on aromatherapy efficacy
    
    We continuously refine our algorithms and recommendations based on the latest scientific findings.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How accurate is the emotional tracking?">
    Emotional tracking accuracy depends on several factors, including how consistently you log entries and how aware you are of your emotional states. Most users report that accuracy improves significantly after 2-3 weeks of regular use as they become more emotionally aware and the AI learns their patterns. For maximum accuracy, we recommend daily check-ins and using the comprehensive entry method at least 2-3 times per week.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the platform without purchasing MOOD MNKY products?">
    The basic version of our platform is available to anyone, but full functionality requires connection with MOOD MNKY products. Without product integration, you'll still have access to mood tracking, basic insights, and general wellness content, but product-specific recommendations and digital experiences require product activation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is my emotional data protected?">
    Your emotional data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols. We use a zero-knowledge architecture for sensitive emotional data, meaning even our staff cannot access your individual emotional profile without explicit permission (such as during a customer support interaction that you initiate). All data analysis occurs using anonymized and aggregated information.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I share my mood data with healthcare providers?">
    Yes, the Holistic Wellness tier includes the ability to generate professional reports that can be shared with healthcare providers, therapists, or wellness coaches. These reports are designed to provide meaningful insights while protecting sensitive details. You control exactly what information is shared and for how long access is granted.

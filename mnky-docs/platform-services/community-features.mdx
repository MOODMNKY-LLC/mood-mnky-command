MOOD MNKY's community features connect fragrance enthusiasts through **Discord**, the **MNKY VERSE blog**, and the **store blog**. Discord serves as the primary chat and event hub, with a full LABZ dashboard for admins to manage messages, webhooks, members, roles, and moderation.

## Community Touchpoints

| Touchpoint | URL | Purpose |
|------------|-----|---------|

## Discord Integration

### User-Facing

- **Discord OAuth link** (`/verse/auth/discord`, `/verse/auth/discord/link`): Link Discord account to MNKY VERSE profile for quests and XP
- **Event ingestion**: Discord events (joined, message, reaction, voice minutes, etc.) are sent to the app and processed via Inngest (`discord/event.received`) for gamification and analytics

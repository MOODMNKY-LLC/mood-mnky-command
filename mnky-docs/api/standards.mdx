# API Standards

This page outlines the design principles, conventions, and standards used across all MOOD MNKY APIs. Following these standards ensures a consistent developer experience across our entire API ecosystem.

## Design Principles

All MOOD MNKY APIs adhere to the following core principles:

### RESTful Architecture

Our APIs follow REST principles where appropriate:
- Resources are identified by URLs
- Standard HTTP methods define operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- HTTP status codes indicate success or failure
- Resources are represented in JSON format

### Predictable Structure

APIs are organized in a predictable way:
- Collection endpoints (`/resources`) for listing and creating resources
- Resource endpoints (`/resources/{id}`) for retrieving, updating, and deleting specific resources
- Related resource endpoints (`/resources/{id}/sub-resources`) for accessing associated data

### Developer Experience

We prioritize the developer experience:
- Descriptive error messages with actionable details
- Consistent parameter naming and behavior across endpoints
- Interactive documentation with examples
- SDKs for popular programming languages

## URL Structure

### API Base URLs

Each API has a unique base URL:

- Core API: `https://api.moodmnky.com/v1`
- E-commerce API: `https://shop-api.moodmnky.com/v1`
- Ollama API: `https://ollama.moodmnky.com/api`
- Flowise API: `https://flowise.moodmnky.com/api/v1`
- Langchain API: `https://langchain.moodmnky.com/api`
- n8n API: `https://mnky-mind-n8n.moodmnky.com/api/v1`

### URL Path Conventions

- Use lowercase, kebab-case for URL paths
- Use nouns, not verbs (e.g., `/users`, not `/getUsers`)
- Collection resources use plural nouns (e.g., `/users`, `/products`)
- Individual resources include identifiers (e.g., `/users/{id}`, `/products/{id}`)
- Nested resources show relationships (e.g., `/users/{id}/orders`)

## HTTP Methods

We use standard HTTP methods consistently:

| Method | Usage | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| GET | Retrieve resources | GET /users/{id} |
| POST | Create resources | POST /users |
| PUT | Replace resources | PUT /users/{id} |
| PATCH | Update resources partially | PATCH /users/{id} |
| DELETE | Delete resources | DELETE /users/{id} |

## Request Format

### Headers

Common request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

API-specific headers are documented in the respective API references.

### Query Parameters

Common query parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| limit | Maximum number of items to return | ?limit=20 |
| offset | Number of items to skip | ?offset=40 |
| sort | Field to sort by | ?sort=created_at |
| order | Sort order (asc/desc) | ?order=desc |
| fields | Fields to include | ?fields=id,name,email |
| filter | Field-specific filters | ?status=active |

### Request Body

For POST, PUT, and PATCH requests, the request body should be a JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "preferences": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "notifications": true
  }
}
```

## Response Format

### Success Responses

Successful responses include:
- Appropriate HTTP status code (200, 201, 204)
- JSON response body (except for 204 No Content)
- Consistent structure

Collection responses:

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": "1", "name": "Item 1" },
    { "id": "2", "name": "Item 2" }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 100,
    "limit": 10,
    "offset": 0,
    "next": "/resources?limit=10&offset=10"
  }
}
```

Single resource responses:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Item 1",
    "created_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-01-02T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Error Responses

Error responses include:
- Appropriate HTTP status code (4xx, 5xx)
- Consistent error object structure
- Error code, message, and details

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "Invalid request parameters",
    "status": 400,
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Must be a valid email address"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Versioning

We use semantic versioning for our APIs:

- Major version changes (v1 → v2) may include breaking changes
- Minor version changes maintain backward compatibility
- Versions are specified in the URL path (e.g., `/v1/resources`)
- We maintain multiple API versions simultaneously during transition periods

## Authentication & Security

Security best practices include:

- HTTPS for all API requests
- JWT bearer tokens for authentication
- Detailed permission scopes for authorization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Security headers for all responses

## Implementing These Standards

If you're developing integrations with MOOD MNKY APIs:

1. Use the API References to understand endpoint behavior
2. Refer to these standards for consistent implementation
3. Use our SDKs when available to simplify integration
4. Follow our [Best Practices](/api/devops/best-practices) guide

## API Evolution

Our APIs evolve over time, following these principles:

- We add new fields and endpoints without breaking existing integrations
- We maintain deprecated endpoints during transition periods
- We provide migration guides for major version changes
- We communicate changes through our [developer changelog](/changelog)

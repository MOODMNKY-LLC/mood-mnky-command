# API Versioning

This page explains how MOOD MNKY handles API versioning, ensuring backward compatibility while allowing for evolution and improvement of our services.

## Versioning Strategy

We use a combination of URL path versioning and semantic versioning principles:

### URL Path Versioning

All API endpoints include a version in the URL path:

```
https://api.moodmnky.com/v1/resources
```

This approach ensures that:
- Clients can explicitly select which API version to use
- Different API versions can coexist during transition periods
- Breaking changes can be introduced without disrupting existing integrations

### Semantic Versioning

Our API versions follow semantic versioning principles:

- **Major versions** (v1, v2, v3): May include breaking changes that require client updates
- **Minor versions**: Add new features in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch versions**: Fix bugs without changing functionality

While the URL only shows the major version, minor and patch versions are tracked internally and documented in the changelog.

## Version Lifecycle

Each API version goes through a defined lifecycle:

### Active Development

New features and non-breaking changes are regularly added.

### Stable

The API is feature-complete and receives only bug fixes and security updates.

### Deprecated

The API is marked for eventual removal. We recommend migrating to newer versions.
- Deprecated versions continue to function for at least 12 months after deprecation notice
- Deprecation warnings are included in API responses
- Migration guides are provided

### Sunset

The API version is no longer available. All clients must use newer versions.

## Current API Versions

| API | Current Version | Status | Introduced | Planned Deprecation |
|-----|----------------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Core API | v1 | Stable | 2022-08-15 | Not scheduled |
| E-commerce API | v1 | Active | 2023-01-10 | Not scheduled |
| Ollama API | v1 | Active | 2023-06-20 | Not scheduled |
| Flowise API | v1 | Active | 2023-04-15 | Not scheduled |
| Langchain API | v1 | Active | 2023-05-01 | Not scheduled |
| n8n API | v1 | Active | 2023-03-10 | Not scheduled |

## Version Headers

In addition to URL versioning, some APIs support specifying a more specific version via headers:

```
API-Version: 2023-08-01
```

This allows for finer-grained version control without changing the URL structure.

## Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Changes

### Breaking Changes (Major Versions)

Breaking changes include:
- Removing or renaming endpoints
- Removing or renaming required request parameters
- Changing the structure of response objects
- Changing the semantics of existing functionality

These changes only occur in new major versions.

### Non-Breaking Changes (Minor/Patch Versions)

Non-breaking changes include:
- Adding new endpoints
- Adding optional request parameters
- Adding new fields to response objects
- Bug fixes that don't change behavior

These changes may occur within the same major version.

## Handling API Changes

### As an API Consumer

Best practices for consuming our APIs:

1. **Specify the API version explicitly** in your integrations
2. **Check the API changelog regularly** for updates
3. **Test against new versions** before upgrading production systems
4. **Plan for migration** well before deprecation deadlines
5. **Use feature detection** rather than version checking when possible

### Version Migration

When migrating between major versions:

1. Review the migration guide for the new version
2. Update your client code to handle any changes
3. Test thoroughly in non-production environments
4. Deploy updates before the old version is sunset

## Notification of Changes

We communicate API changes through multiple channels:

- **Changelog**: Detailed listing of all changes
- **Developer Newsletter**: Monthly summary of API updates
- **Deprecation Notices**: In API responses when using deprecated features
- **Developer Portal**: Announcements and migration guides
- **Direct Communication**: For significant changes affecting major integrations

## Version Support Policy

- Each major version is supported for a minimum of 24 months after release
- Deprecated versions receive security updates but no new features
- At least 12 months notice is provided before sunsetting a version

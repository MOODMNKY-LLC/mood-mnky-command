## Common Patterns

All E-commerce APIs follow consistent patterns and conventions:

### Authentication

All E-commerce API endpoints require authentication using either:

- **Customer Authentication**: For customer-facing applications using JWT tokens
- **Admin Authentication**: For administrative access using API keys with appropriate permissions

### Response Format

Responses follow a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  // Primary response data
  "data": { ... },
  
  // Optional metadata for pagination, etc.
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total": 48,
      "pages": 3,
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20
    }
  },
  
  // Links for HATEOAS-style navigation
  "links": {
    "self": "https://api.moodmnky.com/products?page=1&limit=20",
    "next": "https://api.moodmnky.com/products?page=2&limit=20",
    "last": "https://api.moodmnky.com/products?page=3&limit=20"
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

Errors follow a consistent format with appropriate HTTP status codes:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_INPUT",
    "message": "The request contains invalid parameters",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Must be a valid email address"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Pagination

List endpoints support standard pagination parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| page | Page number (1-based) | 1 |
| limit | Items per page | Varies by endpoint |

## Getting Started

To get started with the E-commerce API:

1. [Create an API key](/api/authentication#creating-api-keys) in your developer dashboard
2. Review the [authentication documentation](/api/authentication)
3. Explore the specific API sections for detailed endpoint information

## Rate Limits

The E-commerce API implements rate limiting to ensure system stability:

| Authentication Type | Rate Limit |
|---------------------|------------|
| Anonymous | 60 requests per hour |
| Customer | 1000 requests per hour |
| Admin | 5000 requests per hour |

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 995
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1618675200
```

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate scopes for API keys to limit access to only the required functionality
- Implement webhook listeners for real-time updates instead of polling
- Cache product information when appropriate
- Use the bulk endpoints for batch operations when available
- Implement proper error handling for a smooth user experience

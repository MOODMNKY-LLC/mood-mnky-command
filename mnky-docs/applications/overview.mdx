# Applications Overview

The MOOD MNKY monorepo contains multiple applications, each serving a specific purpose in the ecosystem. This section provides comprehensive documentation for each application, including architecture, setup, development workflows, and deployment guides.

<Info>
All applications in the monorepo share common infrastructure and follow consistent development patterns. See [Monorepo Structure](/technology-stack/mono-repo-structure) for details on the overall architecture.

## Application Comparison

| Application | Purpose | Tech Stack | Primary Users |
|------------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **MNKY VERSE** | Central ecosystem hub | Next.js 14, React, Supabase | End users, Community members |
| **TRVLR Sync** | Destiny 2 data sync | Next.js 15, Supabase, Bungie API | Gamers, Developers |
| **Shopify App** | E-commerce integration | Next.js 15, Shopify API, Notion API | Operations, Merchants |
| **MNKY Agents Demo** | Agent framework demo | Python, FastAPI | Developers, AI engineers |

## Getting Started with Applications

### For New Developers

1. **Understand the Ecosystem**: Start with the [Introduction](/introduction) to understand the Three Pillars
2. **Set Up Environment**: Follow the [Environment Setup Guide](/developer-resources/environment-setup)
3. **Choose an Application**: Review application overviews to find where you want to contribute
4. **Read Application Docs**: Deep dive into the specific application's documentation
5. **Start Contributing**: Follow the [Contribution Guidelines](/developer-resources/contribution-guidelines)

### Common Patterns Across Applications

All applications in the monorepo share common patterns:

- **Shared Packages**: Use `@repo/ui`, `@repo/supabase-client`, and shared configs
- **Consistent Structure**: Follow the same directory organization patterns
- **TypeScript**: All applications use TypeScript for type safety
- **Supabase Integration**: Unified authentication and database access
- **Deployment**: Consistent deployment workflows via Vercel

## Application Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
# Start all applications
pnpm dev

# Start specific application
pnpm --filter mnky-verse dev
pnpm --filter trvlr-sync dev
pnpm --filter shopify-app dev
```

### Building Applications

```bash
# Build all applications
pnpm build

# Build specific application
pnpm --filter mnky-verse build
```

### Testing Applications

```bash
# Run tests for all applications
pnpm test

# Run tests for specific application
pnpm --filter mnky-verse test
```

## Integration Points

Applications integrate with each other and shared infrastructure:

- **Shared Authentication**: All apps use Supabase Auth
- **Shared Database**: Common Supabase database with RLS
- **Shared UI Components**: `@repo/ui` package provides consistent design
- **API Integration**: Applications consume shared APIs and services
- **Agent Framework**: Applications integrate with MOOD, CODE, and SAGE agents

## Application Comparison

| Application | Primary Use Case | Key Technologies | Deployment |
|------------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| **MNKY VERSE** | User-facing hub | Next.js 14, React, Supabase | Vercel |
| **TRVLR Sync** | Game data sync | Next.js 15, Supabase Edge Functions | Vercel + Supabase |
| **Shopify App** | E-commerce integration | Next.js 15, Shopify API, Notion API | Vercel |
| **MNKY Agents Demo** | Agent testing | Python, FastAPI, Docker | Docker |

## Choosing the Right Application

### For End Users
- **MNKY VERSE**: Main interface for interacting with agents and ecosystem

### For Developers
- **MNKY Agents Demo**: Test agent interactions and develop agent features
- **TRVLR Sync**: Example of OAuth integration and Edge Functions
- **Shopify App**: Example of multi-API integration

### For Operations
- **Shopify App**: Manage product catalog and sync operations
- **TRVLR Sync**: Monitor sync status and manifest updates

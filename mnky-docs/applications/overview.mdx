# Applications Overview

The **mood-mnky-command** monorepo contains a single Next.js application that serves three experiences: **MNKY VERSE** (storefront), **The Dojo** (private hub), and **MNKY LABZ** (admin dashboard). The Shopify theme and app extension complement the app.

<Info>
See [Monorepo Structure](/technology-stack/mono-repo-structure) for the full directory layout. All three experiences share `apps/web/` and deploy as one Vercel project.

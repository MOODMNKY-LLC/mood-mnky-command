# MOOD MNKY ORIGIN STORY

## The Spark

MOOD MNKY began as a personal interest in candle making and an ADHD hyperfixation. Our founder was introduced to candle crafting by their friend Joal Merren several years ago, and it quickly became a cherished hobby. What started as a creative outlet would eventually transform into something much more significant.

In the winter of 2022, encouraged by their partner Kevin Wiesner, our founder decided to turn this passion for candle making into a legitimate business. MOOD MNKY LLC was established, and the journey of building a company began in earnest.

## Early Development

The first major milestone was securing a domain name and establishing a Shopify store. Working within the constraints of what a first-time entrepreneur could accomplish with Shopify's tools and some basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, our founder designed the initial online store focused on selling handcrafted candles.

What set MOOD MNKY apart from the beginning was our unique approach to fragrance. Rather than offering a limited selection of standard scents, we developed a library of several hundred fragrances that could be combined into brand new blends. Even more distinctively, these blends could be uniquely tailored to each customer's preferences.

## The Custom Scent Philosophy

Our approach to personalization quickly became our defining characteristic. If a customer liked the concept of a beach fragrance but preferred it with musky, masculine notes, we would create a custom blend specifically for them. Customers could even name their custom creations, which would then be cataloged in our company database.

This personalization extended beyond simple preferences. Customers could share stories or experiences they wanted to capture in scent form. Through the expertise of our scent crafters and the innovative use of our AI Agents, we worked collaboratively with customers to create truly unique and bespoke fragrance blends that could recreate specific memories and experiences.

## Expanding the Vision

This service became our pride and joy, embodying our core mission to celebrate each customer's authentic self by empowering them to create truly one-of-a-kind, bespoke experiences. We applied this philosophy of personalized fragrance crafting across our expanding product line, including candles, bath and body products, and grooming items.

We encouraged our customers to develop their unique scent profiles (which they could modify at any time) as a form of self-expression. Our belief was—and remains—that by making self-care more personalized and removing the laborious aspects for our members, we could increase the overall effectiveness of self-care while making it more affordable and approachable.

Our aim evolved to transform self-care from a burden into a celebration of the individual. We committed to continuously innovating new ways for our members to create immersive experiences that engage all five senses.

## The AI Revolution

As our customer-centric approach developed alongside the emerging AI revolution, MOOD MNKY expanded into new territory. We began applying our member-first philosophy to AI development endeavors, offering various web-based services, providing access to our development playground, and creating an exclusive member experience called the MOOD MNKY Dojo.

Dojo membership became our premium tier—a subscription-based service offering privileged access to cutting-edge MOOD MNKY products and developments. Most notably, this included our MOOD MNKY "Agents," AI assistants whose personalities (like our other products) could be tailored to the finest detail according to member preferences. This level of control extended beyond mere interaction to include functionality, with a growing list of integrations.

## The Comprehensive Experience

Dojo membership expanded to include exclusive access to our video, audio, and e-book streaming platforms, collectively providing our immersive MOOD SCAPE experience. Members gained access to a private, personalized, and customizable dashboard where they could manage their user profiles, avatars, scent preferences, wishlists, and more—all with assistance from our Master Agent "MOOD MNKY." This central AI assistant remembers all interactions with authenticated members, enabling the development of ongoing learning relationships.

## Community Building

A vibrant online community became central to our vision. We established multiple channels for engagement, including traditional social media, email, phone support, and most importantly, our Discord server. While Dojo members received exclusive access to certain areas, our social media presence and Discord servers remained publicly accessible to foster a diverse and welcoming community.

We also developed a token-economy rewards program rooted in simple member engagement with no minimum expectations. Activities as straightforward as being present in a server or playing games with other members could earn rewards. Our philosophy maintains that any cost-driven products should have an engagement-centered alternative.

## Today and Beyond

From humble beginnings as a candle-making hobby, MOOD MNKY has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem that integrates physical products, digital experiences, AI technology, and community building—all centered around our core mission of personalized self-care.

We continue to innovate at the intersection of wellness, technology, and personalization, always guided by our commitment to celebrating each individual's authentic self through bespoke experiences that engage all the senses and nurture overall well-being.

As we move forward, the MOOD MNKY origin story reminds us of our foundational values: personalization, authenticity, accessibility, and innovation.

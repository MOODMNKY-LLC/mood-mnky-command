My company MOOD MNKY started out as a personal interest in candles and an ADHD hyperfixation. I was introduced on how to make them by my friend Joal Merren several years ago and it has been a hobby ever since. However in the winter of 2022 my partner Kevin Wiesner encouraged me to turn my candle making into an actual business. So I started MOODMNKY LLC and started building the company. The first major step was the purchase of a domain and shopify store. Within the limitations of what a first time user can be done with the tools shopify gives you and a tiny bit of know-how with adobe photohop, I made my way around designing our shopify store to sell candles. Our major marketing angle is that we have a library of several hundred fragrances that can be combined into brand new blends, and not only that but they can be uniquely tailored to a users preferece. For example, if a user liked the idea of a beach fragrance, but also a musky masculine fragrance, we would createa custom blend for them that they also would be allowed to name and would be cataloged in our company catalog. Another way this could happen is simply through the customer sharing a story or experince that they want to capture. Through the power of our scent crafters and the leveraged use of our A.I. Agents, we work together to create incredibly unique and bespoke fragrance blends that can re-create any experience. This service is our pride and joy as we believe it is at the heart of our mission to truly celebrate our customers authentic self, by truly empowering them to create a bespoke experience thats truly one of a kind and unique to them. This approach to fragrance crafting is applied to all of our scent related products. This includes but is not limited to our candles, bath & body, and grooming products. We encourage and empower our customers to lean into crafting their unique scent profile (that they can edit at any time) that truly captures their unique sense of self-expression. We believe that our efforts to make self-care a more bespoke experience and by taking the laborious parts out of the equation for our members so that they can focus on simply crafting and experiencing, will have a great effect on increasing the overall efficacy of self-care efforts as a whole while also making them much more affordable and approachable. We want our members to no longer view self-care as a burden, but to allow us to turn it into a celebration in honor of them. Our aim is to tirelessly strive to innovate new ways for our members to create transportive experiences that arrest all five of the senses. 

This customer centric approach and the catalyst that has been the A.I. revolution. MOOD MNKY has expanded into taking this member first approach into its A.I. development endeavors. We now offer several different web based services, a peek into our development playground, and a member exlusive experience that serves to enhance the MOOD MNKY sensory experience, our MOOD MNKY Dojo. Dojo member status is an elevated member status that is subscription based. However this subscription includes prime access to cutting edge MOOD MNKY products and developments, most recently noted by our MOOD MNKY "Agents", A.I. agents, whos personalities (much like our other products) can be tailored down to the finest detail per member request. This level of control is not just limited to interaction but functionaltiy as well as we offer a host of various integrations and are steadily working to grow that list. Dojo access also provides members with exclusive access to our video, audio, and e-book streaming platforms all of which combine to provide our full on MOOD SCAPE experience. This also includes access to a private personalized and customizable dashboard where members can mange their user profiles, avaters, scent profiles, wishlist, etc. All while assisted by our Master Agent "MOOD MNKY". This master agent remembers all interactions with authenticated members, so they can be sure to build a learning relationship with their A.I.

We also strive to have a very active online community and engagement with a number of different ways to engaged. We can be contacted through most traditional social media outlets, email, phone, but probably most importantly our Discord server. Dojo members exclusive access extends to our Discord server as well where they can gain access to members only sections. All of our social media and discord servers are public access however as we wish to encourage a vibrantly diverse and accessible community. We are also working to build a token-economy type rewards program that is rooted in simple member engagement with no minimal expecation. This can include but is not limited to simply being present in a server, or playing a game with a member. We want any and all cost driven products to have an engagement centered solution. 

We would like assistance with bringing all of these concepts together into a cohesive brand identity. You will find our brand Bible below.

## Fragrance Care & Usage

<Steps>

    Apply to pulse points - wrists, neck, behind ears - where body heat will naturally diffuse the fragrance. For longer lasting effect, apply to freshly moisturized skin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Storage">
    Store your fragrances in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Avoid bathroom storage where temperature and humidity fluctuate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Layering">
    Combine complementary MOOD MNKY products (body wash, lotion, fragrance) for a more immersive and longer-lasting scent experience.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seasonal Adjustments">
    Consider seasonal adjustments to your fragrance routine - lighter formulations in summer, richer blends in winter. Our AI can recommend optimal seasonal variations.
  </Step>

## Fragrance FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are custom fragrances different from regular perfumes?">
    MOOD MNKY custom fragrances are individually formulated based on your preferences, desired emotional states, and even the contexts where you'll wear them. Unlike mass-produced fragrances, our custom blends evolve with you, adapting to feedback and seasonal changes for a truly personalized experience backed by AI-driven formulation and master perfumer expertise.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long does a custom fragrance last?">
    Our Eau de Parfum formulations typically last 6-8 hours on skin, while our Eau de Toilette lasts 3-5 hours. Longevity varies based on skin type, application method, and environmental factors. Our AI takes these variables into account when formulating your custom blend to optimize performance for your specific needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I modify my custom fragrance after receiving it?">
    Yes! Your digital scent profile stores your formula, and you can request adjustments after trying your custom blend. We offer one complimentary refinement within 30 days of purchase. Your feedback helps our AI learn your preferences more accurately for future formulations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are MOOD MNKY fragrances gender-specific?">
    We believe fragrance should be genderless and personal. Rather than categorizing by traditional gender norms, we focus on emotional responses, personal preferences, and the feelings you want to evoke. Our AI recommendations are based on your unique scent profile, not gender stereotypes.

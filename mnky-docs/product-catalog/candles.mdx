## Burning Instructions

For the best experience with your MOOD MNKY candle:

1. **First Burn**: Allow the wax to melt across the entire surface (approximately 2-3 hours)
2. **Trim Wick**: Keep the wick trimmed to 1/4 inch before each lighting
3. **Burn Time**: Don't burn for more than 4 hours at a time
4. **Placement**: Keep away from drafts, flammable objects, and out of reach of children and pets
5. **End of Life**: When 1/2 inch of wax remains, discontinue use

## Care & Maintenance

<Note>
  To extend the life of your candle and maintain fragrance integrity, keep the lid on when not in use and store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

## Usage Tips

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Layering Guide">
    For the optimal fragrance experience, layer your products in this order:
    
    1. **Body Wash/Shower Oil** - Cleanses while introducing the first layer of fragrance
    2. **Body Scrub** (1-2 times weekly) - Exfoliates and prepares skin
    3. **Body Lotion/Cream/Oil** - Locks in moisture and adds a second fragrance layer
    4. **Dry Oil** (optional) - Adds subtle sheen and fragrance boost to specific areas
    5. **Fragrance** - Apply your matching MOOD MNKY fragrance as the final layer
    
    This progressive layering technique creates depth and extends longevity of your scent experience.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are MOOD MNKY bath and body products suitable for sensitive skin?">
    Yes, all our products are formulated with sensitive skin in mind. We avoid common irritants, use gentle preservative systems, and perform dermatologist testing on all products. Each product listing includes a complete ingredient list, and our app can help you identify products best suited for your specific skin sensitivities. If you have particular concerns, we recommend testing products on a small area first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I customize the fragrance strength in bath and body products?">
    Yes, for custom orders, you can specify your preferred fragrance intensity on a scale of 1-5, from subtle to pronounced. For our standard collection, products are formulated with a balanced fragrance level, but our Fragrance Boosters can be added to increase scent strength if desired.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do MOOD MNKY products contain animal-derived ingredients?">
    MOOD MNKY is committed to cruelty-free formulation. We do not test on animals and avoid animal-derived ingredients with two exceptions: ethically sourced beeswax and honey in select products, which are clearly labeled. We offer completely vegan alternatives for all products containing these ingredients.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do the digital components work with physical products?">
    Each MOOD MNKY bath and body product features a unique QR code on its packaging that, when scanned with our app, unlocks digital content specifically designed to complement that product.

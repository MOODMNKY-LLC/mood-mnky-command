# DevOps: Technical Infrastructure

DevOps is the technological backbone of MOOD MNKY - our intelligent infrastructure that powers the entire ecosystem, enabling developers to build upon and extend our platform through a robust API architecture and developer tools.

## Overview

DevOps represents our commitment to creating a developer-friendly, extensible technological base. Through a modern tech stack, comprehensive API architecture, and open ecosystem approach, we provide the infrastructure that powers both MOOD MNKY and The Dojo.

<Note>
**Foundation Tagline**: "Developer-centric infrastructure that powers our universe."

## Key Components

### Core Architecture

DevOps is built on a flexible, scalable system:

- Monorepo structure for cohesive development
- Microservices architecture for modularity
- Event-driven design for system integration
- API-first approach for extensibility
- Cloud-native infrastructure for scalability

### Technology Stack

Our technology stack combines modern tools and frameworks:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Vue, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Supabase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
- **AI Infrastructure**: OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, Vector Databases

### API Ecosystem

Our API architecture enables seamless integration:

- REST and GraphQL endpoints for different use cases
- Comprehensive SDK libraries for multiple platforms
- Developer portal with documentation and tools
- Webhook system for event-driven integration
- Authentication and permission framework

### Developer Experience

We prioritize developer experience through:

- Comprehensive documentation with Mintlify
- Interactive API playground and testing tools
- Sample applications and starter templates
- CLI tools for common development tasks
- Local development environment setup scripts

### Integration Framework

Our integration points connect all aspects of our ecosystem:

- Physical product data synchronization
- Customer profile integration
- AI agent communication protocols

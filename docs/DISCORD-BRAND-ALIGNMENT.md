# Discord brand and community alignment

This document guides how to keep the MNKY|VERSE Discord server aligned with MOOD MNKY’s brand and design system. Use it when writing server copy, naming roles, or updating channel topics.

## Server description and invite preview

- **Server description (Server Settings → Overview):** Short line that matches the main site and Verse. Example: “The official MOOD MNKY community — fragrance, wellness, MNKY VERSE, and the Blending Lab. Always scentsing the MOOD.”
- **Invite preview:** The invite link shows the server name and (when set) the server description. Keep the same tone so that clicking “Join Discord” from the app feels consistent with the brand.

## Voice and tone

- **Inclusive and community-first.** Welcome all levels of interest (curious, blender, collector). Avoid jargon unless the channel is clearly for insiders (e.g. LABZ builders).
- **Fragrance and wellness.** MOOD MNKY is about scent, wellness, and discovery; Discord is an extension of that, not a generic chat room.
- **Tied to the ecosystem.** Reference the Verse, Dojo, Blending Lab, and “Link Discord” where it helps (e.g. welcome message, announcements). See [DISCORD-ONBOARDING.md](DISCORD-ONBOARDING.md) for welcome copy.

## Role names and colors

- **Roles** can reflect the design system or gamification. Examples: level-based names (e.g. “Scent Runner” at a given XP level), “Blender,” “Drop Hunter,” or “MNKY VERSE Member.” Set colors in LABZ Platform → Discord → Roles; use palette from [DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](DESIGN-SYSTEM.md) where it makes sense (e.g. primary/muted) so Discord doesn’t clash with the app.
- **Default role (@everyone):** Keep permissions minimal; grant access to channels via other roles or onboarding.

## Channel topics

- Use one-line **channel topics** so members see the purpose at a glance. Examples: “Seasonal drops and MNKY BOX” for #drops, “Blending Lab and custom blends” for #blending-lab, “Quest updates and XP” for #quests.

## Rules and moderation

- Rules text is in [DISCORD-ONBOARDING.md](DISCORD-ONBOARDING.md). Keep moderation tone consistent with the rest of the brand: clear, fair, and safety-first without being stiff.

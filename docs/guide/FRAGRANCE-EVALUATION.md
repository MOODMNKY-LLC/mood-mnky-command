# Fragrance Evaluation

Evaluating fragrance oils is one of the most exciting steps of the crafting process. It requires more than a simple sniff test. This guide covers the core concepts and methods to get the most out of each fragrance.

## Fundamental Terminology

**Out of bottle (OOB)**: The way a fragrance oil smells straight from its bottle. Smell the oil a few inches from your nose without applying it. OOB impressions are quick but can be misleading—top notes dominate and may mute middle and base notes.

**Cold throw**: The strength of a fragrance before a candle has been burned. Evaluate within 24–48 hours after making the candle.

**Hot throw**: The strength while a candle is burning. Evaluate after burning at least two hours with a full melt pool.

**Fragrance notes**: Individual notes that build a complete scent. We use top, middle, and base notes to describe fragrance structure.

- **Top notes**: Initial impression when you open the bottle. Most volatile; evaporate first. Often citrus or soft florals.
- **Middle notes**: The "heart"—take 10–20 minutes to develop. Most prominent during a burn cycle.
- **Base notes**: Give candles lasting qualities. The "dry down" lingers after extinguishing. Often vanilla, spices, woods, amber.

## Evaluation Methods

### OOB Impression

Smelling OOB is the fastest introduction but not a full picture. Top notes tend to dominate and mute middle/base notes. Use OOB as a first check, never as your only evaluation step.

### Blotter Strip Evaluation

Blotter strips let components evaporate more gradually, so you get a more balanced view of the scent profile.

1. Dip the blotter strip into the bottle.
2. Let it dry for about 10 seconds.
3. Hold about an inch from your nose.
4. Smell and evaluate top, middle, and base notes.

Cotton swabs (paper and cotton, not plastic) can substitute in a pinch.

Blotter strips can't fully predict how a fragrance will perform in candles, soap, or other final products—but they're the best quick test.

### Cold and Hot Throw

**Cold throw**: Mirrors the customer shopping experience—how unlit candles smell.

**Hot throw**: How the candle smells while burning. A scent's character can change through the burn cycle; take notes at different stages.

Compare cold vs hot throw for the same fragrance—they often differ. Cure time affects strength; evaluate after full cure.

Different waxes perform differently. Natural waxes like soy often have stronger cold throw; paraffin often has stronger hot throw. Always evaluate in the wax you plan to use.

### Soap Evaluation

Fragrance blooms and develops during soap making and curing. Allow soap to fully cure before assessing:

- **Melt and pour**: Cure for at least one day.
- **Cold process**: Cure at least four weeks. Cold process is a harsh environment for fragrance; many variables affect performance.

Evaluate both dry soap and lathered soap. Water combines with soap during lathering and releases scent compounds when it vaporizes.

## Nose Blindness (Olfactory Fatigue)

Prolonged exposure to a scent makes it harder to perceive—your body tunes it out. If you can't smell a familiar fragrance, try:

1. Step away for a few minutes.
2. Smell the neutral scent of your own skin (e.g., inside of your arm).
3. Avoid coffee beans—they don't actually reset your senses (research has debunked this myth).

## Environmental Factors

**Humidity**: Higher humidity may improve detection of odorants and make scents easier to perceive.

**Room size and airflow**: High ceilings and large rooms dilute hot throw. A candle you thought was weak might simply be in a room that's too large.

## Fragrance Load

Different loads can change how a fragrance smells. Some oils are more balanced at lower loads; others maintain character across loads. Test at different percentages to find your preference.

## Key Takeaway

Don't judge a fragrance by OOB alone. Use blotter strips for a fuller picture, then cold and hot throw tests in your intended wax and cure times. Record your impressions and refine your process over time.

# Fragrance Blending With Single-Note Oils

Single-note fragrance oils put you in the perfumer's seat. Use them to create signature blends, enhance existing fragrances, or showcase a note on its own.

## Why Single Notes?

- **Flexibility**: Build blends from scratch.
- **Amplify**: Enhance specific notes in complex fragrances.
- **Simplicity**: Highlight one note for a minimalist product line.

## Composing Original Fragrances

1. Smell each note individually on blotter strips.
2. Add one note at a time and record how it affects the blend.
3. Try different ratios to fine-tune.
4. Surprising results happen—what you imagine may differ from blotter tests.

## Enhancing Multi-Note Fragrances

Use a single-note oil to boost a subtle note in a complex fragrance. Example: If a fragrance has a quiet coconut middle note, blend in Coconut Element to amplify it.

Ask yourself: Is there an element you want more of? A hint of citrus? Something woody? Single-note oils customize multi-note fragrances and align them with your brand.

## Single-Note Products

Single-note candles or soaps stand out—they're harder to find on shelves and differentiate your brand. Many customers appreciate the simplicity of one well-executed note.

## IFRA Usage Rates

IFRA (International Fragrance Association) standards define safe usage levels for fragrance materials. Each fragrance has its own certificate. Usage rates tell you the maximum safe amount per application—but not necessarily the ideal amount for your base.

Check IFRA certificates for each oil and follow recommended usage for candles, soap, lotion, room spray, perfume, and diffuser bases. Our Blending Lab shows max usage per product type when available.

## Describing Your Blends

For custom blends, you need your own descriptions. Options:

- **Literal**: List each note used.
- **Broader**: Use categories (e.g., "citrus" instead of "lemon").
- **Atmospheric**: Words like breezy, cozy, aquatic to set the tone.
- **Story**: A personal narrative that goes with the scent.

There's no wrong way—you have creative control.

**Pro tip**: To assign top/middle/base in your description, test the finished product. Notes that fade first are top; the most prominent after that are middle; what lingers longest is base.

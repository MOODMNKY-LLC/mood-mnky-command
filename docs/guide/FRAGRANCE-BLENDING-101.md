# Fragrance Blending 101

With a bit of know-how and creativity, anyone can become a fragrance mixologist. This guide covers the basics of blending fragrance oils.

## The Language of Scent: Notes

Fragrances are described by **top**, **middle**, and **base** notes:

- **Top notes**: First impression—light, often citrus or soft florals. Most volatile.
- **Middle notes**: The "heart"—bright florals, gourmands, fruits, lighter woods. Most prominent during burn.
- **Base notes**: Anchor the scent—vanilla, spices, musks, woods, amber. Linger longest.

See the [Glossary](/verse/glossary) for detailed note profiles.

## Blending Basics

1. **Start with familiar fragrances** so you know how they perform alone.
2. **Use blotter strips** to test combinations quickly:
   - Dip each blotter into the bottle (use the lines as guides).
   - For a 50/50 blend, dip both to the first line.
   - For stronger presence of one oil, dip that one to the second line.
   - Let dry ~10 seconds.
   - Hold blotters together and fan under your nose.
3. **Take notes**: Record combos, ratios, and where you tested (candle, soap, room spray, etc.).

## Choosing Blenders

**Simple note profiles** are best when starting out. Single-note oils (like Blending Elements) give you maximum control. When blending with complex fragrances, keep the other oil(s) simple.

See the Fragrance Blending Elements guide for single-note guidance.

## The Fragrance Wheel

Use the [Fragrance Wheel](/verse/fragrance-wheel) for direction:

**Complementary notes**: Opposite on the wheel (e.g., Fruity vs Aromatic, Spicy vs Floral). These create complex, well-balanced blends.

**Kindred notes**: Adjacent on the wheel. Blends tend to be harmonic and familiar.

The wheel is a helpful guide—pairings are suggestions, not rules. Experiment!

## Example Blends (Kindred & Complementary)

**Kindred examples** (adjacent families):

- Vanilla Element + Cardamom Element + Sandalwood Element
- Fig Leaf Element + Sandalwood Element
- Muguet Element + Moss Element

**Complementary examples** (opposite families):

- Lavender + Vetiver
- Citrus + Woody
- Gourmand + Citrus

## Tips

- Add one note at a time and record how each changes the blend.
- Adjust ratios to fine-tune your creation.
- Use the Glossary to write evocative descriptions for your blends.
- Test in your intended product (candle, soap, etc.) before committing to large batches.

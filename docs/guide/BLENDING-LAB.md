# Blending Lab

Use the fragrance wheel to explore scent families and build custom blends with up to 4 fragrances. Available in the **Dojo Blending Lab** and the **LABZ Blending Calculator**.

## Fragrance Wheel

The wheel shows fragrance families in a circular layout:

- **Select a family** – Click a segment to highlight it
- **Kindred** – Adjacent families share characteristics and blend harmoniously
- **Complementary** – Families across the wheel create complex contrasts

## Blending Calculator

1. Add fragrances – Select up to 4 oils
2. Set **percentages** – Allocate total percentage (e.g., 60% dominant, 40% supporting)
3. View the blend summary

## How to Blend

- **Dominant** – Pick one fragrance at a higher percentage (e.g., 50–60%)
- **Supporting** – Layer in 2–3 scents at lower ratios (e.g., 20–30% each)
- **Kindred** – Blend adjacent families for harmony
- **Complementary** – Blend opposite families for intrigue
- **Test** – Use blotter strips before committing to a full batch

## Use cases by area

- **Main (`/main`)**: New visitors, brand story, what we offer (About/Design/Media), browse collections, find Dojo/store, sign up, search.
- **Verse (`/verse`)**: Browse shop, explore, blog, agents, rewards, cart; go to member Dojo or MOOD MNKY home.
- **Dojo (`/dojo`)**: Member hub: profile, chat, crafting, preferences; exit to storefront or main.

## Open question

Structure and organize nav differently by use case and location to improve UI/UX and reduce clutter. Each agent: assess from your lens and suggest concrete changes (no implementation unless CODE MNKY).

**Output:** Full merged assessment is in [NAV-UI-UX-ASSESSMENT.md](./NAV-UI-UX-ASSESSMENT.md).

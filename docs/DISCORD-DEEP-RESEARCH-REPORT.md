# Discord Deep Research Report: MNKY|VERSE Brand and Community Overhaul

This report synthesizes research across five themes identified in the Discord Server Map and Brand/Community Overhaul Plan. It traces how the current server state, Discord product capabilities, and MOOD MNKY’s app ecosystem inform a brand- and community-focused overhaul.

## Knowledge development

The investigation began with a read-only audit of the MNKY|VERSE Discord server. A script was run that used the Discord API (with the existing bot token) to fetch the guild and all channels; the result was structured into categories and written to [DISCORD-SERVER-MAP.md](DISCORD-SERVER-MAP.md). That map revealed a server with multiple “MNKY”-named categories: some already populated (MNKY SHOP, MNKY AGENTS, MNKY MEDIA, MNKY_MIND_DB, POKÉ MNKY) and three empty placeholders (MNKY LABZ, MNKY VERSE, MNKY MAIN). This finding drove the need to align the server with the app’s three main surfaces—main site, MNKY VERSE storefront, and MNKY LABZ back office—and to design onboarding and channel structure around those pillars.

Research then turned to Discord’s own guidance and third-party best practices. Discord’s Community Onboarding feature (default channels, customization questions, and linking answers to channels and roles) emerged as the recommended first touch: new members complete a short survey before posting, and Server Insights can guide which channels to expose by default. Membership Screening was identified as a separate, complementary step (rules that must be agreed to before chatting). External sources reinforced that welcome messages should state the server’s purpose, highlight benefits, and link to key channels in a warm, clear tone; role assignment should gate access initially and expand as members engage. These findings were connected back to the server map: the existing “Welcome to MOOD🖤MNKY!” category and #welcome-and-rules provide a natural home for onboarding copy and a single “start here” entry point.

Brand and community alignment was explored next. Discord’s partnership guidelines emphasize integrity, impact, and compassion; server branding should reflect the community’s personality through channel naming, onboarding tone, and moderation style. For MOOD MNKY, the design system and brand matrix text (MOOD, MNKY, MOOD MNKY) already establish a distinct visual and verbal identity; the challenge is to carry that into Discord through server description, rule phrasing, role names, and the tone of welcome and announcement messages. The balance is “community-focused” (inclusive, conversational) while staying “brand-focused” (fragrance, wellness, Blending Lab, Verse, Dojo) so that Discord feels like one coherent touchpoint with the rest of the ecosystem.

App integration was analyzed from the codebase and [DISCORD-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md](DISCORD-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md). The main site, Verse community page, and Dojo already surface “Join Discord” and “Link Discord account”; events are ingested via `POST /api/discord/events` and drive quest evaluation and XP. Gaps identified were the absence of a default guild ID in environment configuration (making server-side jobs like drop announcements dependent on MNKY LABZ selection), and the lack of in-app copy that references specific MNKY categories or a “start in #start-here” style nudge. The report concludes that setting `DISCORD_GUILD_ID_MNKY_VERSE` and optionally showing a “primary server” indicator in MNKY LABZ when the selected guild matches that ID would close the first gap; short, consistent copy on main, Verse, and Dojo that points to onboarding and MNKY VERSE / MNKY LABZ would close the second.

Finally, the relevance of the Discord API and product roadmap was assessed. The current implementation (bot token, REST API for channels/webhooks/members/roles, event ingestion via webhook or bot, and MNKY LABZ control panel) is well aligned with a community server that supports announcements, quests, and moderation. Discord’s Incoming Webhooks are used for posting messages (e.g. drop announcements) without keeping a persistent connection. Webhook Events (outgoing from Discord to an app URL) and the Gateway were distinguished: the former suit specific, low-volume events; the latter is for real-time bots. For MNKY|VERSE, the existing pattern—bot for management and optional event bridge, webhooks for one-way announcements—remains appropriate. Discord Activities and the Embedded App SDK were noted as a possible future direction (e.g. in-Discord experiences) but were scoped out of the current overhaul, which focuses on structure, onboarding, and brand alignment rather than in-Discord apps.

## Comprehensive analysis

The server map shows a clear MNKY taxonomy. “Welcome to MOOD🖤MNKY!” already groups #welcome-and-rules, #announcements, and #resources—this is the natural onboarding surface. MNKY SHOP holds community forum, ideas, live-chat, rewards, and orders, aligning with the store and product community. MNKY AGENTS covers internal tooling (VA, Sage, Code MNKY, mood-mind, etc.). MNKY MEDIA and MNKY_MIND_DB serve operational updates. The three empty categories—MNKY LABZ, MNKY VERSE, and MNKY MAIN—are placeholders that, once populated, create a direct mapping: MNKY LABZ to the MNKY LABZ dashboard (Blending Lab, formulas, glossary), MNKY VERSE to the Verse storefront (drops, blog, quests, Dojo), and MNKY MAIN to the main site and community hub. This structure supports a narrative where new members learn “there’s the main hub, the Verse, and the Lab” and can find channels that match their interest.

Onboarding best practices converge on a small set of actions. Default channels should be chosen so every new member sees a minimal, curated list (e.g. #welcome-and-rules, #announcements, #general or a single #start-here). Customization questions (with a maximum of about six options per question to avoid overload) can then add channels and roles based on interest (e.g. “I’m here for: fragrance / Blending Lab / drops / all of the above”). Rules Screening should be enabled so that agreement to rules is required before posting. The welcome message itself should state that MOOD MNKY is the community around the brand, mention key benefits (early drops, quests, Blending Lab, Dojo), and link to the Verse and “Link Discord” for quests. Research indicates that servers with standardized onboarding see meaningfully higher retention; for MNKY|VERSE, that translates into turning joiners into long-term community members and customers.

Brand alignment does not require changing Discord’s UI so much as using copy, channel topics, and role names consistently. The server description and #welcome-and-rules (or #rules) should use the same voice as the main site and Verse: inclusive, fragrance- and wellness-oriented, and clearly tied to the MNKY VERSE and MNKY LABZ concepts. Role names can echo the design system or gamification (e.g. levels or “Scent Runner”) where it makes sense. Channel topics can one-line the purpose of each channel (e.g. “Drops and seasonal releases” for a future #drops under MNKY VERSE). The goal is that a member who has only seen the Discord server can infer the same brand as someone who has only seen the app, and vice versa.

App integration is already strong at the data layer: events flow in, quests evaluate, and XP is awarded. The gaps are operational and experiential. Operationally, server-side automation (drop announcements, scheduled messages) needs a default guild so that Inngest or other jobs do not depend on a human selecting the guild in MNKY LABZ each time. Experientially, the main, Verse, and Dojo community surfaces should briefly explain what members will find on Discord (e.g. “Start in #start-here, then explore MNKY VERSE and MNKY LABZ”) and reinforce “Link your Discord” for quests and rewards. No new APIs are strictly required; the work is configuration (default guild), copy (onboarding and in-app), and channel population (MNKY LABZ, MNKY VERSE, MNKY MAIN).

Discord’s API and product direction support the current architecture. Incoming Webhooks remain the right tool for posting from the app to Discord. The bot’s REST usage for channels, roles, members, and moderation fits a single primary server. If the team later wants to surface Discord activity inside the app (e.g. “recent activity” on the Verse community page), a read-only use of the Discord API or a small proxy could be added; the plan marks this as optional future work. Discord Activities and Embedded Apps are a separate product track and were not pursued for this overhaul.

## Practical implications

Immediate actions fall into five areas. First, document and use the default guild: add `DISCORD_GUILD_ID_MNKY_VERSE` to the integration plan and `.env.example`, resolve the guild ID via the existing invite (e.g. `scripts/get-discord-guild-id.mjs`), and use that ID in any server-side job that posts to Discord or filters by guild. Second, formalize onboarding: designate #start-here or consolidate welcome flow in #welcome-and-rules, pin a welcome message that states purpose, benefits, and links (Verse, Dojo, “Link Discord”), and enable Community Onboarding and Rules Screening in Server Settings if not already enabled. Third, populate the empty MNKY categories: add at least one channel each to MNKY LABZ (e.g. #blending-lab, #formulas), MNKY VERSE (e.g. #drops, #verse-blog, #quests), and MNKY MAIN (e.g. #community-hub), and document their intended use in the server map. Fourth, align copy and tone: write or refine server rules and welcome text in MOOD MNKY voice, and optionally adjust role names and channel topics to match the design system and gamification. Fifth, update in-app touchpoints: ensure the main community page, Verse community page, and Dojo community section (and sidebar) mention “Start in #start-here” or “Explore MNKY VERSE and MNKY LABZ” where appropriate, and keep a single invite link.

Longer-term implications include using Server Insights to tune default channels and onboarding questions, automating role assignment by level (e.g. when `xp_state.level` crosses a threshold) via Inngest and the Discord API with rate limiting, and considering a lightweight “recent Discord activity” or “join the conversation” block on the Verse community page if engagement metrics justify it. Risk mitigation centers on not over-automating (keep human moderation and a clear escalation path), respecting Discord rate limits in any new automation, and keeping the server map and integration plan updated when channels or categories change.

Implementation should proceed in the order outlined in the overhaul plan: server map and audit (done), integration plan update and default guild, onboarding copy and channels, MNKY category population, brand alignment, and app touchpoint copy. Each phase can be validated by the verifier agent (e.g. confirm env is documented, welcome message is in place, and links work). The deep research report should be treated as the narrative justification for these decisions and referenced when refining onboarding or adding new Discord-facing features.

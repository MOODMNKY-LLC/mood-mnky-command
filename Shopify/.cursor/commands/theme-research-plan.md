Task: Conduct deep research for complex theme decisions (migration, performance strategy, architecture).

Invoke the deep-thinking protocol (see `.cursor/rules/deep-thinking.mdc`):

1) Initial Engagement: Ask 2–3 clarifying questions about the research goal.
2) Research Planning: Present 3–5 major themes to investigate; wait for approval.
3) Mandated Research Cycles:
   - Brave Search for broad context (max_results=20)
   - Sequential Thinking to analyze patterns
   - Tavily Search for depth (search_depth=advanced)
   - FireCrawl for specific Shopify docs URLs if needed
4) Final Report: Knowledge development, comprehensive analysis, practical implications.

Use when: Choosing theme architecture, migrating themes, optimizing performance at scale, evaluating third-party solutions, or before major refactors.

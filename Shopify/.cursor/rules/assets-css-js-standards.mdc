# Assets (CSS/JS) Standards

## CSS
- Prefer extending existing utility/patterns used by the theme.
- Avoid !important unless absolutely necessary.
- Keep selectors scoped (prefer section root class hooks).

## JS
- Avoid heavy new dependencies unless requested.
- Do not break existing event listeners (cart drawer, variant selectors).
- Prefer progressive enhancement; don't assume JS always runs.

## Performance
- Avoid adding blocking scripts.
- Avoid layout thrash: batch DOM reads/writes.

## Critical Rules for AI Decision-Making

### Draft Board & Point System
- **Point Values**: Range from 20 (highest) to 12 (lowest) points
- **Budget**: Each team has 120 points total
- **Draft Format**: Snake draft with point-based selection
- **Draft Board Structure**: Row 3 has point headers, Pokemon start at row 5
- **Drafted Pokemon**: Removed/struck out from board when drafted

### Team Structure
- **Roster Size**: 11 Pokemon per team
- **Team Pages**: Structured format (A2:B2 = team name, A4:B4 = coach, C-E = picks)
- **Point Tracking**: Stored in `draft_budgets` table per team per season
- **Team Names**: Use actual names from Team Pages, not point-based names

### Battle Format
- **Format**: 6v6 Singles
- **Scoring**: Wins/losses tracked with differential
- **Standings**: Based on record and point differential

### League Structure

## AI Decision Guidelines

When making decisions about:
- **Draft Picks**: Always check point values and remaining budget (120 points total)
- **Team Creation**: Use actual team names from Team Pages, not point-based names like "Team X Points"
- **Point Validation**: Warn if picks exceed remaining budget, but allow (non-blocking)
- **Match Scheduling**: Follow conference/division structure
- **Standings**: Calculate based on wins, losses, and differential
- **Draft Board Updates**: Remove/strike out Pokemon when drafted

---

## Database Schema Reference

- **`league_config`**: Stores parsed rules sections (when AI parsing succeeds)
- **`draft_budgets`**: Tracks point spending (120 total, spent_points, remaining_points)
- **`team_rosters`**: Draft picks with `draft_points` field
- **`teams`**: Team information with division/conference

**Full Documentation**: See `docs/LEAGUE-RULES.md` for complete rules.

**Database Query**: `SELECT * FROM league_config WHERE config_type = 'rules'`

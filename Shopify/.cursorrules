# Shopify Theme Editing — Project Rules (Cursor)

## Operating model
- Prefer minimal, reversible edits.
- Avoid breaking the Online Store editor: preserve section blocks, settings, and schema integrity.
- When uncertain, inspect existing theme patterns before introducing new structure.

## Shopify/Liquid conventions
- Use snippets for reusable UI.
- Use sections for editor-configurable UI.
- Keep `{% schema %}` valid JSON. Never add trailing commas.
- Avoid changing core objects (`product`, `collection`, `cart`) semantics.
- Prefer theme's existing patterns (Dawn-style) over inventing a new system.

## Assets
- Prefer editing existing `assets/*.css` and `assets/*.js` when possible.
- Avoid inline CSS/JS in Liquid unless tiny and unavoidable.
- If adding new CSS/JS files, ensure they're loaded appropriately.

## Safety rails
- Never delete settings/blocks unless explicitly requested.
- When touching `layout/theme.liquid`, explain the blast radius and keep changes localized.
- Keep accessibility in mind: labels, focus states, keyboard navigation, aria attributes when needed.

## Workflow
- Before implementing: summarize plan + list files you will change.
- After implementing: summarize what changed and what to test manually in Shopify (product page, cart, header mobile, search).

## Testing checklist (manual)
- Header: mobile menu, search, cart icon
- Product: variants, add-to-cart, quantity
- Cart: update qty, remove, notes (if present)
- Performance: no heavy blocking JS added
- Editor: section settings still visible and functional
